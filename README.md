## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The system is built on a relational database with multiple interconnected tables to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy. The core tables include:

-   **`AIRPORT`**: Stores details of all airports (e.g., JFK, LAX).
-   **`AIRLINE`**: Contains information about different airlines.
-   **`FLIGHT`**: The central table for all flight schedules.
-   **`PASSENGER`**: Manages passenger information.
-   **`BOOKING` & `TICKET`**: Handle the booking and ticketing process.
-   **`EMPLOYEE` & `CREW_MEMBER`**: Store data for all staff and flight crews.
-   **`FLIGHT_STATUS_LOG`**: An audit table automatically populated by a trigger.

The full schema with all tables, columns, and relationships can be found in the `sql/airport_management_schema.sql` file.

## üíª Technologies Used

-   **Backend:** Python
-   **Database:** MySQL
-   **Connector:** `pymysql` library

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x** installed.
-   **MySQL Server** installed and running. For Debian/Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mysql-server
    sudo systemctl start mysql
    ```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dakshgoel2008/Airport_Management_DB.git
cd airport_management_db
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Database Configuration

1. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your MySQL credentials to this file:

```bash
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
```

### 5. Run the Application

1. Execute the main script from your terminal

```bash
python myWorld.py
```

2. On the first run, the application will ask: `Import schema and data? (y/n):`.

-   You must type `y` and press Enter.
-   This will automatically create the `AIRPORT_MANAGEMENT_DB` database, build the schema, and populate it with sample data.

## How to Use

Once the application is running, you will be greeted with the main menu. Simply enter the number corresponding to the action you wish to perform and follow the on-screen prompts.
